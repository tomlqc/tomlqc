Hi, Iâ€™m @tomlqc.

My main interests are scientific computing, computer science, machine learning and quantum computing.

[**about-quantum**](https://github.com/tomlqc/about-quantum) - Since 2021 I have been working on an introduction to QC on [www.about-quantum.com](https://www.about-quantum.com) - WIP.

[**identify-contrails**](https://github.com/tomlqc/identify-contrails) - My latest project was the implementation and training of image segmentation models with TensorFlow,
in the scope of the
