Hi, I’m @tomlqc.

I like scientific computing, computer science, machine learning and quantum computing.

Two of my spare time projects:

[**about-quantum**](https://github.com/tomlqc/about-quantum) - Introduction to QC on [www.about-quantum.com](https://www.about-quantum.com) - 2021-2023 - WIP.

[**identify-contrails**](https://github.com/tomlqc/identify-contrails) - Implementation and training of image segmentation models with TensorFlow,
in the scope of the
[Google Research - Identify Contrails to Reduce Global Warming](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-research-identify-contrails-reduce-global-warming)
Kaggle competition.
