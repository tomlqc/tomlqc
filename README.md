Hi, I’m @tomlqc.

My main interests are scientific computing, computer science, machine learning and quantum computing.

Since 2021 I have been working on an introduction to QC on [www.about-quantum.com](https://www.about-quantum.com) - WIP.
See [about-quantum](https://github.com/tomlqc/about-quantum).

My latest project was the implementation and training of image segmentation models with TensorFlow,
in the scope of the
[Google Research - Identify Contrails to Reduce Global Warming](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-research-identify-contrails-reduce-global-warming)
Kaggle competition.
See [identify-contrails](https://github.com/tomlqc/identify-contrails).
